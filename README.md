# Ruby On Rails practice

## Web scraping
What I enjoyed about the language:
Easy to get up and running
Good course used BaseRails
Really fun to use but def takes more understanding to use
Hard to know if I longed for anything from html/js/php since it was just a web scraper
Made me want to do more ruby
